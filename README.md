#Items needed: 

--Jupyter python notebook 

--R software 

--Covid dataset (raw version: “main.csv”): https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data#main-table 

--Twitter data 

 

#Contents: 

#Covid dataset analysis: 

--Data preprocessing 

--Building Naïve Bayes 

--Building Decision Tree 

--Building Random Forest 

--Building Kiras 

 

#Use of Twitter data  

--Creation of Word cloud 

--Twitter Sentiment analysis 

--Emotional Analysis 

 

#Procedure for Covid dataset: 

--Data preprocessing and cleaning for Covid dataset: 

--Open Jupyter notebook and import the raw dataset “main.csv” for data processing and run the code. 

--Once step (a) is done and saved, you should get a file like “cleaned_dataset.csv”. 

 

#Building Naïve Bayes for Covid dataset 

--Once step 1 is finished, import the cleaned dataset, “cleaned_dataset.csv”, if not already imported in Jupyter python notebook. 

--Next, import the Naïve Bayes classifier file named, “Naive Bayes.ipynb” 

--Description of the code is available within the file and is executable. 

 

#Use of Decision Tree  

--Load the dataset named “cleaned_dataset.csv” in Jupyter notebook 

--Next, import the file named “Datacleaningcode.ipynb”  

--Click each sections of code to run within the jupyter notebook and is executable. 

#Building Random Forest  

--Load the dataset named “cleaned_dataset.csv” in Jupyter notebook 

--Next, import the file named “RandomForest.ipynb”  

--Click each sections of code to run within the jupyter notebook and is executable. 

 

#Building keras  

--Once step 1 is finished, import the cleaned dataset, “cleaned_dataset.csv”, if not already imported in Jupyter python notebook. 

--Next, import the Keras classifier file named, “Keras_classifier.ipynb” 

--Description of the code is available within the file and is executable. 

 


#Procedure for running the Twitter data 

#Creation of Word cloud 

--Load the “word_cloud_IT631” named file in R studio  

--Select section by section to run and to load the packages to run. n 

--Description of the code is given, and world cloud is produced.
