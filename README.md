# CIS631_Project
Covid-19 Sentiment analysis and predictive analysis project

#Items needed:

--Jupyter python notebook

--R software

--Covid dataset (raw version: “main.csv”): https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data#main-table

--Cleaned dataset 1: "cleaned_dataset.csv"

--Cleaned dataset 2: "cleaned_dataset1.csv"

--Twitter data




#Contents:

#Covid dataset analysis:

--Data preprocessing

--Building Naïve Bayes

--Building Decision Tree

--Building Logistic regression

--Building Kiras




#Use of Twitter data

--Creation of Word cloud

--Twitter Sentiment analysis

--Emotional Analysis




#Procedure for Covid dataset:

--Data preprocessing and cleaning for Covid dataset:

--Open Jupyter notebook and import the raw dataset “main.csv” for data processing and run the code.

--Once step (a) is done and saved, you should get a file like “cleaned_dataset.csv”.

***Update: “cleaned_dataset.csv” dataset is further cleaned and is available as "cleaned_dataset1.csv". You need both the files to run the code.***




#Building Naïve Bayes for Covid dataset

--Once step 1 is finished, import the cleaned dataset, “cleaned_dataset.csv”, if not already imported in Jupyter python notebook.

--Next, import the Naïve Bayes classifier file named, “Naive Bayes1.ipynb”

--Description of the code is available within the file and is executable.



#Use of Decision Tree

--Load the dataset named “cleaned_dataset.csv” in Jupyter notebook

--Next, import the file named “DecisionTreeCode1.ipynb”

--Click each sections of code to run within the jupyter notebook. It is executable.




#Building Random Forest

--Load the dataset named “cleaned_dataset.csv” in Jupyter notebook

--Next, import the file named “Logistic regression1.ipynb”

--Click each sections of code to run within the jupyter notebook.




#Building keras

--Once step 1 is finished, import the cleaned dataset, “cleaned_dataset.csv”, if not already imported in Jupyter python notebook.

--Next, import the Keras classifier file named, “Keras_classifier.ipynb”

--Description of the code is available within the file and is executable.




#Procedure for running the Twitter data

#Creation of Word cloud

--Load the “word_cloud_IT631” named file in R studio

--Select section by section to run and to load the packages to run. n

--Description of the code is given, and world cloud is produced.
